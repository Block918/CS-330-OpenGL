# CS-330-OpenGL

This project has taught me opengl and I really enjoyed working with it throught the term. The design process I followed was working on one piece at a time and then combining them together to make one application. The approach can be used in almost any future work by just breaking down a bigger project into pieces and completing them separately. In this final 3D scene I used a new development strategy by separating out all my files to make it easier for me to read. My approach has evolved by making my code more readable and organized over the course. Computer science will help me achieve my goals because I love working with computers and this will give me the oppurtunity to do it everyday as a job. I really enjoyed working with graphics and visualizations I have never done it before this was my first experience with it. I will definitely continue to work with it and get a better grasp of opengl to possibly work with it in a job setting.
